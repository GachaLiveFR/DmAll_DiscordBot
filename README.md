## Installation : 

To take less off your time, i will explain you step by step. 

# Important 

You need to have NODE.JS installed into your PC or Mac to have fun with my script.

First of all, 

Open your script editor, I really recommend you to have Visual Studio Code to do that because, he has a terminal with it.

Edit the lines 5 and 6

line 5 : Replace the 'tonToken' with your token

line 6 : Replace the 'tonMessage' with the message you will send .

To have your own Discord token, you have 2 options : 

### Option 1 

- Press CTRL + SHIFT + I key to open the -console
- Go to the repertory "Network"
- Right Click on the "Record Network"
- And press 'ALT + F5'
- Go to the folder '@me'
- And your token is in the repertory "Authorization"

### Option 2
This is hard has fu*k so, i didn't recommend you to know that.

# Step 1 : The requested packages

You have to install some more packages : 

axios : Command line ```nmp install axios```
discord.js : Command line ``` nmp install discord.js-selfbot-v13```

# Step 2 : Start your bot

Yay, You made it, now it's time to boot that up!

To start it, you need to open your terminal and type in "node index.js"

### I wish you some love for my DmAll tool and wish you to have fun with it
