## Installation : 

To take less off your time, i will explain you step by step. 

# Important 

You need to have NODE.JS installed into your PC or Mac to have fun with my script.

First of all, 

Open your script editor, I really recommend you to have Visual Studio Code to do that because, he has a terminal with it.

Edit the lines 5 and 6

line 5 : Replace the 'tonToken' with your token
line 6 : Replace the 'tonMessage' with the message you will send .

to have your own Discord token, you have 2 options : 

# Option 1 

- Press CTRL + SHIFT + I key to open the -console
- Go to the repertory "Network"
- Right Click on the "Record Network"
- And press 'F5'
- Go to the folder '@me'
- And your token is in the repertory "Authorization"

# Option 2
This is hard has fu*k so, i didn't recommend you to know that.
